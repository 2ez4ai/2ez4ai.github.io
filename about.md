  Hey there! I am Jingye Wang. You can also call me Allen. I am a second-year master student at ShanghaiTech University. I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from South China University of Technology, where I spent four wonderful years. My interest lies in artificial intelligence in video games.<br><br>
