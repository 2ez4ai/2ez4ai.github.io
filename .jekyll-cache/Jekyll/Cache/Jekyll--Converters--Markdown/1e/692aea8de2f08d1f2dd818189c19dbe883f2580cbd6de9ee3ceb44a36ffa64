<p>Finally this blog has something related to video games. This is my first Unity3D project after attending like three courses of Unity3D. This game is generally based on the <em>perfect match</em> map of <strong>Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout</strong>, as I find the models of that are friendly given my poor modeling skills. Also, it innately allows me to personalize, to some extent, my game by using a different figure set rather than fruits.</p>

<p>The scene includes two main components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a screen to display the target figure and other information;</li>
  <li>a platform consisted of 16 tiles allowing players to stand on.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the players, there is only one controllable and others are actually scripts.</p>

<p>To make the falling reasonable, I use a picture of space as the background. For the choice of items of CSGO, that was my very original idea since they are fascinating and highly distinguishable.</p>

<p>In each round, the game proceeds as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$-1.5$s~$5.0$s,</li>
</ul>

<p>FallGuys:</p>

<p>Oxygen:</p>

<p>Platform:</p>
