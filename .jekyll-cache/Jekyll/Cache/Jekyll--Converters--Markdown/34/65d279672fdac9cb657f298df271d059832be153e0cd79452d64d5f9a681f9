<h1 id="0-introduction">0. Introduction</h1>

<p>The flow of this game (<a href="https://github.com/2ez4ai/GoldSeeker">source</a>) is to collect 10 gold items, <em>i.e.,</em> coins. Some coins can be obtained directly on the map. The others can only be obtained from the creatures.</p>

<p>Compared with my first game <a href="https://2ez4ai.github.io/2021/03/14/Astroxygen/">Astroxygen</a> is my first game, this one is far less interesting. The story and flow is not completed. It seems like I just put all those new things I learnt together in a brute, straightfoward and no surprise way. But still, I gained lots of experience related to models, animations, <em>etc.</em> that the previous one failed to provide.</p>

<h1 id="1-components">1. Components</h1>

<p>The scene includes four main components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a character controlled by a player;</li>
  <li>four enemies;</li>
  <li>two points for save &amp; load;</li>
  <li>quest components: coins and the light indicating the quest done;</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike the previous one, this time I used sophisticated models rather than simple cubes or spheres or capsules. The models I got mainly from <a href="http://mixamo.com/">mixamo</a> and <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models">sketchfab</a>. Actually, at the beginning I tried to make a Chinese style combat game. But when I skimmed the two fancy websites, I found there is little Chinese models. Those closest ones often turn out to be Japanese. That was the first time that I glimpsed the scale of the gap between the two industries. And I believe that one day, games adapted from our Chinese stories can be all the rage.</p>

<h1 id="2-mechanism">2. Mechanism</h1>

<p>Though this game is far more naiver than the previous one, the logic parts are much more complicated. The following content may be confusing if I use wrong game parlance.</p>

<p><strong>Main Character</strong>: it is controlled by a player via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CharacterController</code>. The new feature here is that the control would also affect the <strong>camera</strong>. Also, the player can be  To avoid jumping over othersâ€™ head, which would stack fallguys,  I add an invisiable high cylinder for each of them.</p>

<p><strong>Computers</strong>: to make it of great diversity, I created some materials for skins and outfits from which it choices randomly at the start of the game, and its action and memory are actually done by a lot of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Random.RandomRange()</code>. It does work. I mean, they look like smart and fun enough XD. The move is done by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">move()</code> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CharacterController</code>, where I set the horizontal/vertical input manually according to their position. I intended to implement the move by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NavMeshAgent</code>, but failed to make it due to the platform I implemented is not static.</p>

<h1 id="3-conclusion">3. Conclusion</h1>

<p>This project reminds me of the days when I enjoyed the scenario editors of <em>Age of Empires II</em> and <em>Warcraft 3</em>. But at that time I was like 15 years old, and actually did not make a thing. As for my first project and given such a short time, I think this project is of a high degree of completeness. The main drawback, for me, is the code construction is messy due to my lacking in the game logic in the early stage.</p>
