<h1 id="0-introduction">0. Introduction</h1>

<p>The flow of this game (<a href="https://github.com/2ez4ai/GoldSeeker">source</a>) is to collect 10 gold items, <em>i.e.,</em> coins. Some coins can be obtained directly on the map. The others can only be obtained from the creatures.</p>

<p>Compared with my first game <a href="https://2ez4ai.github.io/2021/03/14/Astroxygen/">Astroxygen</a> is my first game, this one is far less interesting. The story and flow is not completed. It seems like I just put all those new things I learnt together in a brute, straightfoward and no surprise way. But still, I gained lots of experience related to models, animations, <em>etc.</em> that the previous one failed to provide.</p>

<h1 id="1-components">1. Components</h1>

<p>The scene includes four main components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a character controlled by a player;</li>
  <li>four enemies;</li>
  <li>two points for save &amp; load;</li>
  <li>quest components: coins and the light indicating the quest done;</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike the previous one, this time I used sophisticated models rather than simple cubes or spheres or capsules. The models I got mainly from <a href="http://mixamo.com/">mixamo</a> and <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models">sketchfab</a>. Actually, at the beginning I tried to make a Chinese style combat game. But when I skimmed the two fancy websites, I found there is little Chinese models. Those closest ones often turn out to be Japanese. That was the first time that I glimpsed the scale of the gap between the two industries. And I believe that one day, games adapted from our Chinese stories can be all the rage.</p>

<h1 id="2-mechanism">2. Mechanism</h1>

<p>Though this game is far more naiver than the previous one, the logic parts are much more complicated. The following content may be confusing if I use wrong gaming parlance.</p>

<p><strong>Main Character</strong>: it is controlled by a player via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CharacterController</code>. The new feature here is that the control now supports both <strong>keyboard</strong> and <strong>controller</strong>, and we have animations for our character, which is supported with <strong>blend tree</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Third Person Camera</strong>: the control for the main character would also affect the <strong>camera</strong> since they are grouped. More over, it also supports an independently way to control the camera, by using the right click of a mouse (the right joystick of a controller) as the input of the camera’s rotation. I also implemented a naive <strong>lock-on</strong> mechanic. I made it by adding the move input of the player as a factor to the rotation input of the camera, because I want a smooth lock-on rather than in a brutal way.</p>

<p><strong>Enemies</strong>: they now three status: idle, patrol, and attack. All the move related logic is done with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NavMeshAgent</code>. I also add a</p>

<h1 id="3-conclusion">3. Conclusion</h1>

<p>This project reminds me of the days when I enjoyed the scenario editors of <em>Age of Empires II</em> and <em>Warcraft 3</em>. But at that time I was like 15 years old, and actually did not make a thing. As for my first project and given such a short time, I think this project is of a high degree of completeness. The main drawback, for me, is the code construction is messy due to my lacking in the game logic in the early stage.</p>
