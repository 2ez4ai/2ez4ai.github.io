<p>Finally this blog has something related to video games. This is my first Unity3D project after attending like three courses of Unity3D. This game is generally based on the <em>perfect match</em> map of <strong>Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout</strong>, as I find the models of that are friendly given my poor modeling skills. Also, it innately allows me to personalize, to some extent, my game by using a different figure set rather than fruits.</p>

<p>The scene includes two main components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a screen to display the target figure and other information;</li>
  <li>a platform consisted of 16 tiles allowing players to stand on.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the players, there is only one controllable and others are actually scripts.</p>

<p>To make the falling reasonable, I use a picture of space as the background. For the choice of items of CSGO, that was my very original idea since they are fascinating and highly distinguishable.</p>

<p>In each round, the game proceeds as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>-1.5s ~ 0.0s, ready for start;</li>
  <li>0.0s ~ 5.0s, uncover tiles randomly for memorisation;</li>
  <li>5.0s ~ 10.0s, uncover tiles randomly for memorisation; start counting down;</li>
  <li>10.s ~ 15.0s, cover tiles; create oxygen tank randomly;</li>
  <li>15.0s ~ 17.5s, disable moving ability of all players; uncover tiles to show the corresponding figures;</li>
  <li>17.5s ~ 20.0s, disable tiles that showing wrong figures;</li>
  <li>20.0s ~ , reset timer, tiles;</li>
</ul>
